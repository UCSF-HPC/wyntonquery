## Introduction

The SGE accounting file holds information on all submitted and _finished_ jobs submitted to the SGE scheduler.  Queued or currently running jobs are _not_ included in this file.  A job is considered "finished" if it completed successfully, terminated due to an error, or was cancelled.  The file is a colon-delimited text file with one job entry per row, with the most recently finished job appended at end.  Contrary to what one might expect, the file is not _perfectly_ ordered by the `end_time` of the jobs.  We might find some entries where the `end_time` of two consequentive entries might differ by a few seconds in the "wrong" order.  It's not clear to me why this is but it might be that the scheduler updates the SGE accounting file at regular intervals, say every few minutes, and when it does it goes through the jobs in order of job index.


## Reading recent entries

As of June 2021, the Wynton HPC accounting file is ~54 GB with 160.5 million job entries (using `wc -l`).  In March 2020, it was ~12 GB and took 6-8 minutes to read in full.

Here is how we can read the 1 million most recent entries, i.e. the 1 million jobs, including job-array tasks, that finished most recently.

```r
library(wyntonquery)

pathname <- sge_accounting_file()
cat(sprintf("File size: %.3g GB\n", file.size(pathname)/1024^3))
# File size: 53.9 GB

## Read the last 1,000,000 job entries of the accounting file,
## which takes 15-30 seconds to read
njobs <- 1e6
jobs_all <- read_sge_accounting(pipe(sprintf("tail -n %d %s", njobs+4, shQuote(pathname))))

## Statistics of finished jobs
jobs <- jobs_all
period <- range(jobs$end_time, na.rm=TRUE)
nusers <- length(unique(jobs_all$owner))
cat(sprintf("Period: %s/%s\n", period[1], period[2]))
cat(sprintf("Number of jobs finished during this period: %d\n", nrow(jobs)))
cat(sprintf("Number of unique users: %d\n", nusers))
# Period: 2021-06-13 18:15:30/2021-06-16 19:35:15
# Number of jobs finished during this period: 1000000
# Number of unique users: 118
```


### Focus on jobs ended during the last 24 hours

```r
jobs <- subset(jobs_all, end_time >= period[2] - 24*3600)
period <- range(jobs$end_time, na.rm=TRUE)
cat(sprintf("Period: %s/%s\n", period[1], period[2]))
cat(sprintf("Number of jobs finished during this period: %d\n", nrow(jobs)))
Period: 2021-06-15 19:35:15/2021-06-16 19:35:15
Number of jobs finished during this period: 216375
```


### Summary of successful and failed jobs 

```r
## Get successful and failed jobs
jobs <- jobs_all
jobs <- list(
  success = subset(jobs, failed == 0L),
  fail    = subset(jobs, failed > 0L)
)
print(sapply(jobs, nrow))
# success    fail 
#  979905   20095

## CPU time consumed
cpu <- sapply(jobs, function(j) { d <- sum(j$cpu); units(d) <- "days"; d })
print(cpu)
#   success      fail 
# 17742.775  1390.293

## CPU-time fractions
print(cpu / sum(cpu))
#    success       fail 
# 0.92733561 0.07266439
```

From this, we see that during the last 24 hours, 7% of the CPU time was consumed by jobs that failed.  Among the failed jobs, the failure code was distributed as:

```r
print(table(jobs$fail$failed))
#     1     8    21    25    26    27    28    37   100 
#    48     1     1  6873     6     1    11  1639 11515 
```

From `help("read_sge_accounting", package="wyntonquery")` for details on the parsed fields and their data types, these description of some of these codes are:

 *  26: failed opening stderr/stdout file
 *  37: ran but killed because it exceeded the maximum run time (`h_rt`), maximum CPU time (`h_cpu`), or maximum virtual memory (`h_vmem`)
 * 100: ran, but killed by a signal (perhaps due to exceeding resources), task died, shepherd died (e.g. node crash), etc.


The jobs that exhausted their limits, consumed 369 days of CPU time;

```r
> d <- sum(subset(jobs$fail, failed == 37)$cpu); units(d) <- "days"
> d
Time difference of 368.6784 days
```

which corresponds to ~2% of all CPU time consumed;

```r
> as.numeric(d/sum(cpu))
[1] 0.01926917
```
