## Introduction

The SGE accounting file holds information on all submitted and _finished_ jobs submitted to the SGE scheduler.  Queued or currently running jobs are _not_ included in this file.  A job is considered "finished" if it completed successfully, terminated due to an error, or was cancelled.  The file is a colon-delimited text file with one job entry per row, with the most recently finished job appended at end.  Contrary to what one might expect, the file is not _perfectly_ ordered by the `end_time` of the jobs.  We might find some entries where the `end_time` of two consequentive entries might differ by a few seconds in the "wrong" order.  It's not clear to me why this is but it might be that the scheduler updates the SGE accounting file at regular intervals, say every few minutes, and when it does it goes through the jobs in order of job index.


## Indexing the SGE accounting file

In March 2020, it was ~12 GB and took 6-8 minutes to read in full.  As of June 2021, the Wynton HPC accounting file is ~54 GB with 160.5 million job entries.  It is rare to be interested in all entries.  It is more common to work with a subset of the job entries.  In order to do this efficiently, we start by indexing the SGE accounting using:

```r
library(wyntonquery)
progressr::handlers(global = TRUE) ## Report on progress

pathname <- sge_accounting_file()
cat(sprintf("File size: %.3g GB\n", file.size(pathname)/1024^3))
# File size: 54.1 GB

## It takes 5-10 minutes to index a 54 GB SGE accounting file
index <- make_file_index(pathname, skip = 4L)
cat(sprintf("Number of job entries: %d\n", length(index)))
# Number of job entries: 160835061

## Save index to file for future use
save_file_index(index, file = "accounting.index")
```


## Reading job entries in SGE accounting file

Here is how we can read the ~100,000 most recent entries, which only takes a few seconds:

```r
library(wyntonquery)

pathname <- sge_accounting_file()
index <- read_file_index("accounting.index")

from <- 100e3
jobs <- read_sge_accounting(pathname, offset = index[length(index)+1-from])
print(jobs)

_Comment:_ The reason for getting more than 100,000 job entries is that the SGE accounting file had recorded another 3,419 jobs since we last indexed the file.


To read, say, 10,000 jobs starting with job entry 120,000,000, use:

```r
from <- 120000000
jobs <- read_sge_accounting(pathname, offset = index[from], n_max = 10000)
print(jobs)
# A tibble: 10,000 x 45

## Statistics of jobs finished during the last 24 hours


```r
library(wyntonquery)

pathname <- sge_accounting_file()
index <- read_file_index("accounting.index")

## Read enough job entries to cover 24 hours and more
from <- 300e3
jobs <- read_sge_accounting(pathname, offset = index[length(index)+1-from])

period <- range(jobs$end_time, na.rm=TRUE)
cat(sprintf("Period: %s/%s\n", period[1], period[2]))
## Period: 2021-06-17 04:23:00/2021-06-18 09:26:06

## Keep jobs for the last 24 hours
jobs <- subset(jobs, end_time >= period[2] - 24*3600)
period <- range(jobs$end_time, na.rm=TRUE)
cat(sprintf("Period: %s/%s\n", period[1], period[2]))
## Period: 2021-06-15 19:35:15/2021-06-16 19:35:15
cat(sprintf("Number of jobs finished during this period: %d\n", nrow(jobs)))
## Number of jobs finished during this period: 197538

nusers <- length(unique(jobs$owner))
cat(sprintf("Number of unique users: %d\n", nusers))
# Number of unique users: 79
```

Let's see how many of the jobs finished succesfully and how many failed.

```r
## Get successful and failed jobs
groups <- list(
  success = subset(jobs, failed == 0L),
  fail    = subset(jobs, failed > 0L)
)
stats <- sapply(groups, nrow)
print(stats)
# success    fail 
#  191701    5837 

print(stats/sum(stats))
#    success       fail 
# 0.97045125 0.02954875
```

We see that failure rate among the ~200,000 jobs that ran the last 24 hours was ~3%.  Next, let's see how much CPU time this correspondsa to:

```r
## CPU time consumed
cpu <- sapply(groups, function(jobs) { d <- sum(jobs$cpu); units(d) <- "days"; d })
cat(sprintf("Total CPU processing time: %.1f hours\n", sum(cpu)))
# Total CPU processing time: 7937.3 hours

print(cpu)
#   success      fail 
# 7562.2252  375.1175

## CPU-time fractions
print(cpu / sum(cpu))
#    success       fail 
# 0.95274017 0.04725983
```

From this, we find that during the last 24 hours, ~5% of the CPU time was consumed by jobs that failed.  Among the failed jobs, the failure code was distributed as:

```r
print(table(groups$fail$failed))
#   25   26   37  100 
#    5    1 4440 1391
```

From `help("read_sge_accounting", package="wyntonquery")` for details on the parsed fields and their data types, these description of some of these codes are:

 *  25: rescheduling
 *  26: failed opening stderr/stdout file
 *  37: ran but killed because it exceeded the maximum run time (`h_rt`), maximum CPU time (`h_cpu`), or maximum virtual memory (`h_vmem`)
 * 100: ran, but killed by a signal (perhaps due to exceeding resources), task died, shepherd died (e.g. node crash), etc.


The jobs that exhausted their limits, consumed 213 days of CPU time;

```r
d <- sum(subset(groups$fail, failed == 37)$cpu); units(d) <- "days"
print(d)
# Time difference of 212.8236 days
```

which corresponds to ~3% of all CPU time spent:

```r
> as.numeric(d/sum(cpu))
[1] 0.02681296
```
